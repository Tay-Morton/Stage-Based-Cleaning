Today, it still holds that magic.

Four kids and two parents living in the upstairs at 10 had my grandparents moving quickly to build their dream house. 12 was designed by a protege of Frank Lloyd Wright and is a one-of-a-kind style with plenty of light and outside areas for calm meditative moments or kickball.

My grandfather was a Major General, head of the 13th AD, and a graduate of West Point in 1915, along with Eisenhower and Omar Bradley. After getting shot in WW2, his military career ended and he and my grandmother moved to Asheville so he could run the VA Hospital in Oteen. 

The house next door and three acres is what they bought in 1945 after witnessing a double rainbow over the mountains. After my mother and father moved us four kids to the upstairs of that house, my grandparents got an architect who studied with Frank Lloyd Wright to design the mid-century modern house next door, and my childhood was spent going between the houses. 

Four years ago I came up to renovate the place in order to sell it, but after watching a full moon rise over the mountains, I fell in love with it all over again and bought it. It's a comfort knowing this property has never left our family. I can feel all my relations here and enjoy the memories I had, mostly with my loving, brilliant, funny grandmother in this house. It has been a gathering spot for many famous people, including Ike and Mamie, who were close friends of my grandparents, and Carl Sandburg. 

I am an artistic welder and a singer and have travelled all over the world entertaining the troops for the Dept of Defense. Along the path of my travels, I always appreciated the kindness of locals who guided me when lost or recommended flavorful local places set apart from the tourist track. I'm here to offer you the same guidance.

There are sculptures and furniture inside and around my property that I made. 

 I love meeting new people, and I also love my privacy. I respect guests privacy as well and am available with any questions, concerns, interests you may have, but otherwise will not intrude. I live upstairs, and I am sensitive to being quiet. I encourage my guests to feel right at home. 

The expansive yard has plenty of areas to sit and enjoy a cup of coffee or a cocktail. The garden beds have herbs you are welcome to use.

Feel free to text with any questions prior to your stay as well as during your stay.

I have lived in several European countries, studied abroad several times and so speak several European languages, or at least I did at one time. I have enjoyed diving with sharks in Bora Bora and skydiving in New Zealand, where I lived twice. I have backpacked Central America and lived in Mumbai. I have been away from my home for about 7 years and have been dreaming about it all the while. I hope you will enjoy it as much as I do!

Those mountains, so different from the beaches of her childhood, kept her coming back for ten years. There is something majestic about the Blue Ridge Mountains that blanket Western North Carolina, at over 1 billion years old, they are some of the oldest mountains in the entire world.

Arturo came to Asheville for the first time in 2012 and was quickly enamoured with the outdoor culture, so different from his 22 years in New York City, but so reminiscent of his childhood in the gentle hills of Puebla, Mexico. For him, it was a desire to start a family and a business and seek a better quality of life and he quickly found himself thirsty for everything that Asheville has to offer.

Emilie and Arturo met in 2008 while working together as sommeliers in the Lower East Side of Manhattan at The Ten Bells. Their working relationship was incredible, and over the next six years that relationship became a fine tuned machine- customers would always comment about the way they were able to seamlessly run the entire restaurant without even speaking. Learning the way one another worked over those first six years was the beginning of a true friendship that blossomed into love.

With 35 years of fine dining experience between the two, a Bed and Breakfast seemed like the perfect next adventure. Their penchant for hospitality and intuitive service and their true joy in meeting new people and making new friends put them in a unique position to choose their next path.

Emilie’s first Bed and Breakfast plan was written in the back of a college notebook when she was 18, wandering around Maine searching for the perfect wraparound porch. In 2011, she and Arturo decided to give those Bed and Breakfast dreams a trial run, and opened a small B&B in their East Village apartment. While tiny, it gave them a wonderful test-run on breakfast planning, scheduling, cleaning, decorating, recipe testing and conflict management. They loved it all!

The tri-lingual couple feel that they will bring a new, re-invented experience to the somewhat clichéd country B&B Inn. Asheville is no longer a sleepy town with boarded up buildings, it is a hub of restaurants, nightlife, music, beer and outdoor adventure. It’s not only the perfect place to call home, it is the perfect place to welcome someone into yours.",within an hour,100%,100%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/0bbcb598-86ac-492d-a721-f2082d3b88ba.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/0bbcb598-86ac-492d-a721-f2082d3b88ba.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,2,2,"['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'reviews', 'kba', 'work_email']",t,t,"Asheville, North Carolina, United States",28801,35.60302,-82.54885,Entire apartment,Entire home/apt,2,1 bath,1,1,"[""Air conditioning"", ""Self check-in"", ""Bedroom comforts"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Heating"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Indoor fireplace"", ""Free parking on premises"", ""Wifi"", ""TV"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Bathroom essentials"", ""Iron"", ""Coffee maker"", ""Kitchenette""]",$200.00 ,2,365,1,2,365,365,1.3,365,t,8,20,44,114,7/10/21,97,22,3,12/28/20,6/20/21,5,4.96,4.96,4.98,4.98,4.98,4.92,t,2,1,1,0,14.92

I grew up in New Orleans and we enjoy getting back to the “Big Easy” as often as possible.  You’ll see flavors of New Orleans around our home.  My work as a licensed esthetician has taken me to Atlanta, St. Lucia and Saint Simons Island, GA as well as New Orleans.  

Michael grew up in the Atlanta area and has lived and worked around the world.  After spending 3 1/2 years in western Ethiopia, he lived in Indonesia for 7 years, then Indianapolis for about 15 years.    

Michael’s work in international nonprofits has allowed us to travel together in Asia, Africa and South America. You’ll see hints of those travels in our home.  Since my father was born in Sicily, we have enjoyed reconnecting with family back in the “old country.”

I am a bit of a cinemaphile.  In addition to my collection of old movies (even some old video cassettes - - and yes we still have a VCR in addition to our DVD player), I enjoy the oldies and classics on TV and Netflix.  I also enjoy cooking - - occasionally resorting to some of my old ""N’awlins"" dishes.

We enjoy gardening.  I specialize on the designing and Michael handles a lot of the physical work - - at least outside.  I love creating and tending miniature gardens that enjoy the year-round beauty of our sunroom.

Sometimes I can host more actively, and sometimes I'm swamped with other plans. I respect my guest's privacy and do not enter their rooms while rented. Mainly I like to check in when you're coming and going, but sometimes I end up making fun friends and going out to events together. So far, everyone who has visited has been a kind soul looking to experience the best that Asheville has to offer, and has been comfortable and satisfied with their experience. I love this little city so much, it is my joy to accommodate liberal minded travelers with a relaxed environment and convenient location.",within an hour,100%,96%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/fefc4ecf-8bcc-4bed-a359-efa7c7e47c0d.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/fefc4ecf-8bcc-4bed-a359-efa7c7e47c0d.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,2,2,"['email', 'phone', 'reviews', 'offline_government_id', 'kba', 'selfie', 'government_id', 'identity_manual']",t,t,"Asheville, North Carolina, United States",28805,35.5838,-82.5302,Private room in house,Private room,3,1 private bath,1,2,"[""Microwave"", ""Free parking on premises"", ""Luggage dropoff allowed"", ""Dedicated workspace"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Free street parking"", ""Air conditioning"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Hangers"", ""Keypad"", ""Iron"", ""Coffee maker"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Private entrance"", ""Heating"", ""Essentials"", ""Shampoo"", ""Hot water"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Wifi"", ""Bed linens"", ""Kitchen""]",$79.00 ,1,16,1,2,16,16,1.9,16,t,27,54,84,359,7/10/21,72,14,2,1/20/18,7/5/21,4.92,4.97,4.8,4.97,4.97,4.94,4.79,f,1,0,1,0,1.7

Cheryl and I are passionate about hosting!  Both of us have a long history of hospitality experience - I have over 15 years in Hotel Management experience in the Tampa Bay & Chicago areas and Cheryl has been a Pastry Chef in fast-paced well-known hotels and restaurants in New York City and Chicago.  In fact, we moved from Chicago to the Asheville Area approximately 6 years ago when Cheryl was offered a position at the Inn on Biltmore Estate.  I currently work at a large car dealership in town and Cheryl blogs and helps run our home based Airbnb business.

As hosts for Airbnb, we have enjoyed opening our private suites to guests (and their furry family members) from all over the world.  We try to offer our guests what we like when we travel - a comfortable and stylish place to relax.  What's more, we enjoy traveling with our 2 small dogs (Lola and Archie) and look for pet-friendly accommodations with no extra pet fees!

We love Asheville and we see ourselves continuing our life's journey in this beautiful eclectic Mountain community.  Cheryl and I first met and dated in high school.  In fact, she was my high school sweetheart in 1986!  Although we lost track of each other over the next twenty years, we met again at our high school reunion and (needless to say) the rest is history.  

Come stay with us!  We would love to share our private suites and everything that Asheville has to offer.

I have lived in the Asheville area since 2009. I met my husband here and we have been married since 2012. We have 2 children. A 5 year old girl and a 1 year old boy.  

After our first child was born I became a ""work from home"" mom, and now I oversee our rentals. We started our first rental in December of 2016 and I absolutely fell in love with doing it, so much so, that we started up another rental in March of 2018. I can't put my finger on what exactly I love about it, but I just do. I love the freedom it gives me to be with my kids and handle the ""unexpected."" I also love that it allows me to be more hands on with guests or handle issues or needs in person vs. over the phone or having someone else do it for me. 

5 things I can't live without.....
coffee
massages
doing anything and everything outdoors
giving my kids kisses and hugs everyday and playing with them
and, yeah....wine and beer

My husband and I are very laid back, fun, outdoorsy people. We love everything outdoors. You name it, we do it. We also love to travel, especial out of the country.
Favorite hobbies include gardening, canning, raising cows, fishing, mountain biking, hiking, and exploring new restaurants.

We are always on the go and it seems like something unexpected always happens or changes our plans, so I would have to say our life motto is, ""just roll with the punches and deal with it as best you can."" Nothing is perfect and stuff happens. How you handle it determines the end result.

Passionate for travel and exploration, Asheville called us both to be part of the eclectic and vibrant tapestry of Western North Carolina. With seven years of “local” between us, we have immersed ourselves in our town and constantly explore this ever-changing canvas that is AVL.  With a longtime dream of working together as small business owners, we combined both our love of nesting (and all things home) and hospitality into a special combination. Thus, our business ""Two Hammers"" was born. Read more about us on our website (two-hammers) or find us on social media.

About Emily: Emily is a creative type, with a mind for business. When not playing host or designing properties and interiors, she can be found in her art studio dabbling and making art. From paper sculpting, collaging with vintage jewelry, teaching silk painting, block printing and needle felting, she loves to dabble. If not in her art studio, she’s probably dancing at her local dance studio of choice, where she spends way too much of her time. An avid foodie and culture seeker, she is always searching for hidden gems in town and surrounding area. A self-proclaimed history and architecture “nerd”, she is the first person to talk about the Biltmore and other local historical spots. She lives outside of Biltmore Village with her beloved dog, Kaia, and cat, Jezebel.

About Annie: Annie is a natural born helper. She has always had a passion and heart for serving others. That passion has led her down many different paths, whether that's studying social work at Warren Wilson College, doing various volunteer work or, most recently, earning her 200 hour yoga teacher training.  Being in the hospitality industry felt like a natural fit and an extension of her talents.

The owner purchased this apartment in 2013

Why the owner chose Downtown
After a prolonged search for a downtown property to develop, he had the good fortune to acquire 59 Broadway, an unused warehouse for the previous ten years, in remarkably sound condition and with a good soul. The building was a clean canvas on which to create and provided an opportunity to favorably impact the neighborhood in which it was located. After a year of planning, a project incorporating the interplay of nature, urban, and personal environments, was begun. Completed in December of 2015, The Sinclair was designed and built for generations to come.

What makes this apartment unique
The Sinclair was built with attention to space, lighting, quality, and simplicity. Twelve-foot ceilings, original hardwood flooring, simple layout, and uncluttered space help convey a deep feeling of comfort. Unlike any other historic building in downtown, there are windows all along the northern wall providing an abundance of natural light to the interior space of the residences further enhancing the unique ambiance. Furnishings, although simple, are complete and of high quality including the art on the walls and accessories throughout. Full length window seats allow you to engage the urban environment just outside the window but in the quiet and comfort of the interior accommodations.

At first I was studying to be a priest but later realized that comforting people can be done in more ways than from that approach. Meeting, greeting and engaging guests without agenda puts them at ease and when guests arrive with little or few expectations and are open to my quirky approach to life, magic happens. Giving give wide berth for your privacy, but there when social interaction is desired.
I've learned that I can only try and please everyone. That works for 97% of the time. Occasionally guests cannot let go of stress and innate suspicions, and that is baggage that I cannot carry for them. With an open mind and heart you will have on of the best experiences you can at an Airbnb establishment.

  I grew up in Atlanta and discovered Asheville by way of Maui. I'd lived there and on Kauai for a few years and when it came time to move back closer to family a friend suggested Asheville  as an alternative to the big city.  He’d grown up in Chapel Hill and had spent time in Asheville too. 
 So, after enough culture shock back in Atlanta I decided to explore Asheville in the late 90’s. After being here for a week or so wuth my dog Buddy I knew I'd found our new home.  I'd also developed a love of old houses in Atlanta from a early age so I got this 1927 bungalow in 2000. 
In 2006 I decided to create a new space with a view. Only by cleaning my gutters did I notice what a great view to the west there was from a slightly higher perspective. So, I designed and built the “Treetop Loft” and lived up there for many years. I now love sharing this space and the feedback I get.
 I'm a closet artist so you'll see a few of my abstract paintings up there. 
The larger ones are all downstairs so feel free to ask if you have an interest. I’m also avid motorcyclist, lover of the outdoors and great beer so Asheville has been the perfect home ! 

  I do hope you enjoy Asheville as much as I do !

Growing up Santa Fe, NM I saw a unique blend of artistic community, endless outdoor opportunities, interesting history, beautiful landscapes, and a diverse mix of cultures.

Though far from Santa Fe and a different climate, I arrived in Asheville in the early 90’s to practice Chinese Medicine and felt some of the same elements at play.  Asheville was not well known, but you could feel the energy building and the mixture of art, landscape, environment, history and community all coming together.  It reminded me of my ‘early days’ in Santa Fe.  

One of my closest friends was Andy Brokmeyer, who I told for several years that he needed to come to Asheville, as it was a dynamic and exciting place.  We were also avid kayakers, and Asheville has been a Mecca for kayaking since the early days of the sport so I knew I could lure him out with the promise of all the great rivers in the area. 

He came out ‘for a visit’ and hasn’t left.  That was 16 years ago.  

Asheville has grown into the most happening place in the region, far beyond my expectations, and has sustained an authentic, community oriented and dynamic quality.  Like my dad used to say about few places, it has ‘cultural energy’. 

Though both Andy and I had done some residential real estate investment and development, 80 N Lexington was our first move into the commercial side.  It was an old building, greatly in need of repair, and was a bit removed from the core downtown commercial traffic.  We scraped together what we could and fixed it up, with an eye towards something special in the future. 
 
Now, many years later, North Lexington Ave is hopping, with restaurants, breweries, bars, tea houses, coffee shops, galleries and wonderful, diverse retail shops right out the door.  

And 80 N Lexington has been transformed into a blend of funky, hip, and industrial intertwined with lush, upscale design.  A mix of style and comfort that is unique and authentically Asheville.

About 5 years ago, I discovered an old ramshackle, tear down house on this fabulous lot and I knew immediately this place would be my “landing”. Dennis was a bit skeptical about the new construction venture but eventually joined in to help create what has now become our mutual dream home! We knew when we started, we wanted to share it with family and friends (including you) and have made some wonderful lifetime connections as a result.

I’m recently retired and in addition to spending time with family, I love to dance (shag is my favorite), and swim.  

Dennis is a PA at a family practice in Asheville.  His other passions include running, landscaping,  and woodworking. As you pull up the Laura’s Landing pictures, notice the bedroom furniture, vanity, bar area, table and picture frames. His wood shop is upstairs across the driveway and he loves to show it off!

We both enjoy walking around downtown, sampling the local cuisine and listening to live music. There is always something going on in Asheville - 12 months a year!

Growing up Santa Fe, NM I saw a unique blend of artistic community, endless outdoor opportunities, interesting history, beautiful landscapes, and a diverse mix of cultures.

Though far from Santa Fe and a different climate, I arrived in Asheville in the early 90’s to practice Chinese Medicine and felt some of the same elements at play.  Asheville was not well known, but you could feel the energy building and the mixture of art, landscape, environment, history and community all coming together.  It reminded me of my ‘early days’ in Santa Fe.  

One of my closest friends was Andy Brokmeyer, who I told for several years that he needed to come to Asheville, as it was a dynamic and exciting place.  We were also avid kayakers, and Asheville has been a Mecca for kayaking since the early days of the sport so I knew I could lure him out with the promise of all the great rivers in the area. 

He came out ‘for a visit’ and hasn’t left.  That was 16 years ago.  

Asheville has grown into the most happening place in the region, far beyond my expectations, and has sustained an authentic, community oriented and dynamic quality.  Like my dad used to say about few places, it has ‘cultural energy’. 

Though both Andy and I had done some residential real estate investment and development, 80 N Lexington was our first move into the commercial side.  It was an old building, greatly in need of repair, and was a bit removed from the core downtown commercial traffic.  We scraped together what we could and fixed it up, with an eye towards something special in the future. 
 
Now, many years later, North Lexington Ave is hopping, with restaurants, breweries, bars, tea houses, coffee shops, galleries and wonderful, diverse retail shops right out the door.  

And 80 N Lexington has been transformed into a blend of funky, hip, and industrial intertwined with lush, upscale design.  A mix of style and comfort that is unique and authentically Asheville.

Growing up Santa Fe, NM I saw a unique blend of artistic community, endless outdoor opportunities, interesting history, beautiful landscapes, and a diverse mix of cultures.

Though far from Santa Fe and a different climate, I arrived in Asheville in the early 90’s to practice Chinese Medicine and felt some of the same elements at play.  Asheville was not well known, but you could feel the energy building and the mixture of art, landscape, environment, history and community all coming together.  It reminded me of my ‘early days’ in Santa Fe.  

One of my closest friends was Andy Brokmeyer, who I told for several years that he needed to come to Asheville, as it was a dynamic and exciting place.  We were also avid kayakers, and Asheville has been a Mecca for kayaking since the early days of the sport so I knew I could lure him out with the promise of all the great rivers in the area. 

He came out ‘for a visit’ and hasn’t left.  That was 16 years ago.  

Asheville has grown into the most happening place in the region, far beyond my expectations, and has sustained an authentic, community oriented and dynamic quality.  Like my dad used to say about few places, it has ‘cultural energy’. 

Though both Andy and I had done some residential real estate investment and development, 80 N Lexington was our first move into the commercial side.  It was an old building, greatly in need of repair, and was a bit removed from the core downtown commercial traffic.  We scraped together what we could and fixed it up, with an eye towards something special in the future. 
 
Now, many years later, North Lexington Ave is hopping, with restaurants, breweries, bars, tea houses, coffee shops, galleries and wonderful, diverse retail shops right out the door.  

And 80 N Lexington has been transformed into a blend of funky, hip, and industrial intertwined with lush, upscale design.  A mix of style and comfort that is unique and authentically Asheville.

A few random thoughts as 2019 is winding down.  We have a few quiet weeks before the holiday and I have been thinking about the many guests who joined us this year.

Our specialty is large groups who want to spend time together In Asheville with all the comforts of home.   Bachelorette’s and Wedding Parties are probably the top occasions.   We also get to meet quite a few corporate executives who visit for team building.   All in all this has been a great year and I look forward to meeting your group, should you find yourself headed this way.

New thought:  Today is Friday January 11th, 2019. It is an otherwise typical, winter day here in the beautiful mountains of Asheville, NC. I have my usual work, building homes and raising a family. Something came to me this morning that I can’t help but mention.

For the past few months I knew it was coming. More on this later. First, some of the backstory...

My family travels occasionally and when we do, we tend todo so in a large group. We always book with Airbnb and invite our friends and family to join us.

A few years ago we rented a very cool, mid-century modern pool home in Fort Lauderdale. The place was decorated on the minimal side and was totally spotless. There was a lot of room for our friends and family and we had an amazing trip.

After that, I could not stop thinking about how to recreate the experience as a host in Asheville.  

I decided to stop building houses for sale and started designing them to keep.   

Now, life revolves around hosting our guests each week on a new street full of custom vacation rentals called Upstream Way.   

The properties are perched above the river and are close to downtown. The houses are all 4 stories tall and provide amazing panoramic views. Each floor has multiple master bedrooms and private baths. Lots of balconies and outdoor space. The furniture and finishes are right out of a magazine.

The first three available are Upstream Bohemian (sleeps 14-16) and the Upstream Penthouse (sleeps 16-18). I just finished The Upstream Bachelorette and we already have multiple bookings lined up! We are now breaking ground on a new custom home at 34 Upstream. We also have a retreat center in the works! 

In my quest to recreate our favorite Airbnb moments, I try very hard to make your visit special. If you have any requests to best prepare your house for arrival, please let me know.   

You can depend on me 100% during your stay. If anything comes up you can call me or text 24/7. You will never get an answering service or a stranger.

I was raised in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico, where my father taught photography and journalism at the Instituto Allende. I still have the home there in which I grew up!
I moved to Sausalito, California where I became a Strategy Implementation Consultant. As a bilingual and bicultural person, I was able to work  in 11 countries in Western Europe, South America, and North America. It was a great life, and I met wonderful people from all over the world.    I am also a song-writer and an author, and love music of all kinds from all parts of the world.

     In 2001, my husband and I moved to Asheville, NC, and we love it! Being in the mountains, in a glorious little town is perfect for us in our retirement phase of life, or our ""repurposed"" phase, as my husband likes to say.   
     We have two small dogs (a chihuahua mix and a mountain feist, both under 16 pounds). 
     We live on two acres, surrounded by wonderful, local neighbors that we are blessed to have around us.  
     We are foodies, love to cook and love to eat out, and can recommend lots of restaurants, though it's hard to keep up as a new and great one seems toped up every week here!
     We're easy going, like hosting friends, family and our AirBnB guests. Kelle was in the hotel and restaurant business decades ago, and this is a gentle step back into something she found much fun to pursue.

As you move through this life and this world you change things slightly, you leave marks behind, however small. And in return, life—and travel—leaves marks on you.”  – Anthony Bourdain.

We LIVE to travel! Heather spent many years working in the airline industry which allowed us to see 40+ countries. The Anthony Bourdain show “No Reservations”  sums up our travel style. We tend to book the first night to recover from jet lag and then keep the rest of the trip open. We like to see where our travels want to take us. Seeking out the “undiscovered” places and truly connecting with locals is what we are all about. Some of our favorites: Luang Prabang / Bagan / Zanzibar / Bali / Colombia / Ronda (got engaged) / Samana, Dominican Republic (got married) / Chicago / Isla Holbox (shhhh, keep it a secret). Through many of these travels Airbnb has been a big piece of the puzzle.  

The two of us met in Aspen, CO. Heather is originally from Chicago and Mark from Virginia Beach. Although Heather loved city life her wanderlust brought her to Aspen for thirteen years.  Mark had been living in Washington D.C. doing the daily grind as an architect and had heard about a firm in Aspen that was hiring. He jumped on the chance and never looked back!  Aspen was a fantastic place to live and truly enjoy life. It taught us that you can live more simply and have a healthier quality of life. 

After a long stint out west and with a child on the way we decided it was time to be closer to family. We had a list of 30 towns all over the midwest and eastern U.S. which we either visited or did research on. After visiting Asheville we knew it was our next stop in life. Mark has opened his own office and Heather teaches at a creative arts center while studying interior design. Besides continuing to travel, we hike with our son and two dogs as often as possible and love checking out the awesome breweries and restaurants Asheville has to offer. We've also just begun hosting on Airbnb and really enjoy meeting fellow travelers and hosting them in our guest suite. 

We hope to inspire others to get out of their comfort zone and check out other places and people on this amazing planet!

It seems like there are so many houses on AirBnB that people have difficulty figuring out which properties are good to visit and which are hiding behind trick photography.   It takes a lot of time and energy to find the good ones and hopefully our new website will help.

A few random thoughts as 2019 is winding down.  We have a few quiet weeks before the holiday and I have been thinking about the many guests who joined us this year.

Our specialty is large groups who want to spend time together In Asheville with all the comforts of home.   Bachelorette’s and Wedding Parties are probably the top occasions.   We also get to meet quite a few corporate executives who visit for team building.   All in all this has been a great year and I look forward to meeting your group, should you find yourself headed this way.

New thought:  Today is Friday January 11th, 2019. It is an otherwise typical, winter day here in the beautiful mountains of Asheville, NC. I have my usual work, building homes and raising a family. Something came to me this morning that I can’t help but mention.

For the past few months I knew it was coming. More on this later. First, some of the backstory...

My family travels occasionally and when we do, we tend todo so in a large group. We always book with Airbnb and invite our friends and family to join us.

A few years ago we rented a very cool, mid-century modern pool home in Fort Lauderdale. The place was decorated on the minimal side and was totally spotless. There was a lot of room for our friends and family and we had an amazing trip.

After that, I could not stop thinking about how to recreate the experience as a host in Asheville.  

I decided to stop building houses for sale and started designing them to keep.   

Now, life revolves around hosting our guests each week on a new street full of custom vacation rentals called Upstream Way.   

The properties are perched above the river and are close to downtown. The houses are all 4 stories tall and provide amazing panoramic views. Each floor has multiple master bedrooms and private baths. Lots of balconies and outdoor space. The furniture and finishes are right out of a magazine.

The first three available are Upstream Bohemian (sleeps 14-16) and the Upstream Penthouse (sleeps 16-18). I just finished The Upstream Bachelorette and we already have multiple bookings lined up! We are now breaking ground on a new custom home at 34 Upstream. We also have a retreat center in the works!

My mom's side of the family has lived in Western North Carolina for the past century and a half. I have relatives buried in the Riverside Cemetery, which we can see from our backyard.
However, I lived most of my adult life on the West Coast. After college, I drove west in a school bus and eventually landed outside Eugene, OR, next to a creek, grew lots of my food, and had a sewing business, selling at the Saturday Market, Circle of Hands and craft fairs up and down the West Coast.
I have been to all 50 states, Canada, several Central American countries, Caribbean islands and Europe. I LOVE meeting people from all around the world and have studied conflict resolution in large groups of people using World Work. I am a therapist full time, offering massage therapy as well as Bodywisdom Therapy, helping people unravel the messages of their bodies, at a location on Merrimon Avenue. I speak a bit of French and Spanish, but am alas, no longer fluent.
My son and I moved back to WNC several years ago to be near my Mom, who lives in Yancey County. I know some sweet areas to visit around the area and are including them in a notebook in the rooms. 
I love being able to offer people a centrally located place to enjoy what WNC has to offer, as well as a prime walking neighborhood to have access to downtown Asheville hotspots. 
I turned both bedrooms and bathrooms downstairs into places that I would like to visit myself, using art from my own collection, and textures and colors that I love.
We have friends and family over on a regular basis so there is a bit of hustle and bustle at times. If you have children, or like to come and go and appreciate the outdoors, you will fit right in!

My mom's side of the family has lived in Western North Carolina for the past century and a half. I have relatives buried in the Riverside Cemetery, which we can see from our backyard.
However, I lived most of my adult life on the West Coast. After college, I drove west in a school bus and eventually landed outside Eugene, OR, next to a creek, grew lots of my food, and had a sewing business, selling at the Saturday Market, Circle of Hands and craft fairs up and down the West Coast.
I have been to all 50 states, Canada, several Central American countries, Caribbean islands and Europe. I LOVE meeting people from all around the world and have studied conflict resolution in large groups of people using World Work. I am a therapist full time, offering massage therapy as well as Bodywisdom Therapy, helping people unravel the messages of their bodies, at a location on Merrimon Avenue. I speak a bit of French and Spanish, but am alas, no longer fluent.
My son and I moved back to WNC several years ago to be near my Mom, who lives in Yancey County. I know some sweet areas to visit around the area and are including them in a notebook in the rooms. 
I love being able to offer people a centrally located place to enjoy what WNC has to offer, as well as a prime walking neighborhood to have access to downtown Asheville hotspots. 
I turned both bedrooms and bathrooms downstairs into places that I would like to visit myself, using art from my own collection, and textures and colors that I love.
We have friends and family over on a regular basis so there is a bit of hustle and bustle at times. If you have children, or like to come and go and appreciate the outdoors, you will fit right in! If you want privacy, the private entrance and keypad will fit your needs. If you want total peace and quiet, I am afraid we won't be your cup of tea.
Living lightly on the earth is a core value for me so we recycle as much as possible, and keep our throwaway consumables to a minimum.

Growing up Santa Fe, NM I saw a unique blend of artistic community, endless outdoor opportunities, interesting history, beautiful landscapes, and a diverse mix of cultures.

Though far from Santa Fe and a different climate, I arrived in Asheville in the early 90’s to practice Chinese Medicine and felt some of the same elements at play.  Asheville was not well known, but you could feel the energy building and the mixture of art, landscape, environment, history and community all coming together.  It reminded me of my ‘early days’ in Santa Fe.  

One of my closest friends was Andy Brokmeyer, who I told for several years that he needed to come to Asheville, as it was a dynamic and exciting place.  We were also avid kayakers, and Asheville has been a Mecca for kayaking since the early days of the sport so I knew I could lure him out with the promise of all the great rivers in the area. 

He came out ‘for a visit’ and hasn’t left.  That was 16 years ago.  

Asheville has grown into the most happening place in the region, far beyond my expectations, and has sustained an authentic, community oriented and dynamic quality.  Like my dad used to say about few places, it has ‘cultural energy’. 

Though both Andy and I had done some residential real estate investment and development, 80 N Lexington was our first move into the commercial side.  It was an old building, greatly in need of repair, and was a bit removed from the core downtown commercial traffic.  We scraped together what we could and fixed it up, with an eye towards something special in the future. 
 
Now, many years later, North Lexington Ave is hopping, with restaurants, breweries, bars, tea houses, coffee shops, galleries and wonderful, diverse retail shops right out the door.  

And 80 N Lexington has been transformed into a blend of funky, hip, and industrial intertwined with lush, upscale design.  A mix of style and comfort that is unique and authentically Asheville.

 I currently split time between Asheville and Wilmington North Carolina; was born in Greensboro; raised in Durham; went to college in Chapel Hill; had my first professional job in Raleigh; lived in Charlotte for a few years, and have been coming  to the mountains (Asheville) and the beach (Emerald Isle/Morehead City/Atlantic Beach/Beaufort) since before I could walk.  I have deep roots in the state of North Carolina and some relatives who have been very involved in its growth and development.  This includes a grandmother who co-wrote the first guidebook about Western North Carolina (Rudy) as well as a few baby kissers .;)

As a hostess, I'm channeling those relatives and all they have taught me about southern hospitality.  Sharing North Carolina culture is truly in my DNA.  As a traveler I look forward to being a good guest and experiencing your town/city.   Either way, excited to meet new people and further expand my worldview...green lights all the way!!!

My husband and I are looking forward to hosting guests in our home as well as being a guest of others during our travels. We became AirBnB hosts in 2014 and have since hosted more than 2,000 bookings. In 2018, we became AirBnB superhosts!

We live in Asheville in the beautiful mountains of western North Carolina.

Allison works as a fourth grade teacher at Mills River Elementary School. Peter works as the Trails Coordinator at a regional land trust, Conserving Carolina. Both of us work to keep this region we love as wonderful as it is today, and make it even better for future generations.

We love to take road trips throughout the year. We have appreciated the kindness of many over the years who have let us stay in their home or camp in their yard, or have rented a room to us for a reasonable rate. We are guests who are focused on our travels and we most often are seeking simply a room to hang our hat for the night before our travels resume the following morning. For that reason, most hosts barely know that we are there. In appreciation for the kindness shown to us over the years, we pay it forward by being clean and courteous when we are guests in the homes of others, and we are seeking to host guests who are similarly self-sufficient and simply seeking a basic place for the night.

We look forward to you staying in our home!",within an hour,100%,100%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/b5841b8c-1865-4caa-b9a7-d6a9396a5d90.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/b5841b8c-1865-4caa-b9a7-d6a9396a5d90.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,2,2,"['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'google', 'reviews', 'jumio', 'offline_government_id', 'selfie', 'government_id', 'identity_manual']",t,t,"Asheville, North Carolina, United States",28803,35.49063,-82.51478,Private room in house,Private room,2,1 private bath,1,1,"[""Air conditioning"", ""Hot water"", ""Heating"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Patio or balcony"", ""Keypad"", ""Security cameras on property"", ""Wifi"", ""Lock on bedroom door"", ""TV"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Bed linens"", ""Essentials"", ""Outdoor furniture"", ""Free parking on premises"", ""Hot water kettle"", ""Shampoo"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Free street parking""]",$46.00 ,1,7,1,1,1125,1125,1,1125,t,14,44,74,74,7/10/21,184,134,6,2/4/21,6/21/21,4.85,4.91,4.85,4.96,4.93,4.92,4.91,f,3,0,3,0,35.16

I moved to Asheville in (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) from Austin, TX soon after graduating with a degree in mechanical engineering. The mountains called my name, and my would-be manager also called my name (to offer me a job),  so I set out on the 17hr drive and only looked back once...because I thought I saw a bear.

 I began my career servicing CTs, MRIs, and X-ray systems throughout Western North Carolina. If I'm not working on the house or hanging with the fam, my free time is spent playing outdoors - kayak fishing, mountain biking, and rock climbing. 

If there's an opportunity to go fishing, I usually take the bait. I own a small fleet of fishing kayaks and like to take day trips out on the local waters to pursue bass, trout and gorgeous scenery. If you're in the neighborhood to catch some fish, let me know and Ill try to give you some tips on where to go. 

Asheville is a mountain biker's paradise. There's an expansive network of trail systems all throughout the surrounding forests lands and hitting the trails with the gang is a surefire way to put a smile on my face. IMO its the best way to submerse yourself in these mountains and take in all their beauty. If you're itching for a thrilling downhill adventure or a casual bike ride through the mountains, reach out and I can point you in the right direction.

I moved to Asheville in the early 90's to escape Northern Virginia and my post-college cubicle job. I wanted to be a songwriter...which thrilled my parents to no end.  

Turns out, Asheville was the perfect place to be creative, get quiet, wake the heck up - and spend the next 15 years as a touring performing songwriter on my own record label. (Shared stages with everyone from The Beach Boys to John Mayer to Nanci Griffith - and made 7 CD's along the way.)

In 2010, as a result of requests from so many creative entrepreneurial types (and being burnt out from 250 days a year on the road), I started a business coaching company here in Asheville. That became an online training resource, and we've hosted clients from all over the world at our retreats and events here. These days, like so many of us, I spend more time on Zoom than anything else. :)

Hosting guests has been an unexpected joy and new passion for me.  I love being able to provide all the amenities and experiences for travelers and vacationers and work-from-homers... mostly based on 15 years of staying in every hotel (ahem, and motel) chain and city across the U.S.  I'm still learning constantly!

I love all things nature. Trees, birds, bears, mountains, dirt. I strive to contribute the creative and natural spirit of this precious spot, even as it grows at a crazy pace.

Cheryl and I are passionate about hosting!  Both of us have a long history of hospitality experience - I have over 15 years in Hotel Management experience in the Tampa Bay & Chicago areas and Cheryl has been a Pastry Chef in fast-paced well-known hotels and restaurants in New York City and Chicago.  In fact, we moved from Chicago to the Asheville Area approximately 6 years ago when Cheryl was offered a position at the Inn on Biltmore Estate.  I currently work at a large car dealership in town and Cheryl blogs and helps run our home based Airbnb business.

As hosts for Airbnb, we have enjoyed opening our private suites to guests (and their furry family members) from all over the world.  We try to offer our guests what we like when we travel - a comfortable and stylish place to relax.  What's more, we enjoy traveling with our 2 small dogs (Lola and Archie) and look for pet-friendly accommodations with no extra pet fees!

We love Asheville and we see ourselves continuing our life's journey in this beautiful eclectic Mountain community.  Cheryl and I first met and dated in high school.  In fact, she was my high school sweetheart in 1986!

In 2016 we switched from another vacation rental website to Airbnb which proved to be a very pleasant and profitable experience.

I moved to Asheville in the early 90's to escape Northern Virginia and my post-college cubicle job. I wanted to be a songwriter...which thrilled my parents to no end.  

Turns out, Asheville was the perfect place to be creative, get quiet, wake the heck up - and spend the next 15 years as a touring performing songwriter on my own record label. (Shared stages with everyone from The Beach Boys to John Mayer to Nanci Griffith - and made 7 CD's along the way.)

In 2010, as a result of requests from so many creative entrepreneurial types (and being burnt out from 250 days a year on the road), I started a business coaching company here in Asheville. That became an online training resource, and we've hosted clients from all over the world at our retreats and events here. These days, like so many of us, I spend more time on Zoom than anything else. :)

Hosting guests has been an unexpected joy and new passion for me.  I love being able to provide all the amenities and experiences for travelers and vacationers and work-from-homers... mostly based on 15 years of staying in every hotel (ahem, and motel) chain and city across the U.S.  I'm still learning constantly!

Growing up Santa Fe, NM I saw a unique blend of artistic community, endless outdoor opportunities, interesting history, beautiful landscapes, and a diverse mix of cultures.

Though far from Santa Fe and a different climate, I arrived in Asheville in the early 90’s to practice Chinese Medicine and felt some of the same elements at play.  Asheville was not well known, but you could feel the energy building and the mixture of art, landscape, environment, history and community all coming together.  It reminded me of my ‘early days’ in Santa Fe.  

One of my closest friends was Andy Brokmeyer, who I told for several years that he needed to come to Asheville, as it was a dynamic and exciting place.  We were also avid kayakers, and Asheville has been a Mecca for kayaking since the early days of the sport so I knew I could lure him out with the promise of all the great rivers in the area. 

He came out ‘for a visit’ and hasn’t left.  That was 16 years ago.  

Asheville has grown into the most happening place in the region, far beyond my expectations, and has sustained an authentic, community oriented and dynamic quality.  Like my dad used to say about few places, it has ‘cultural energy’. 

Though both Andy and I had done some residential real estate investment and development, 80 N Lexington was our first move into the commercial side.  It was an old building, greatly in need of repair, and was a bit removed from the core downtown commercial traffic.  We scraped together what we could and fixed it up, with an eye towards something special in the future. 
 
Now, many years later, North Lexington Ave is hopping, with restaurants, breweries, bars, tea houses, coffee shops, galleries and wonderful, diverse retail shops right out the door.  

And 80 N Lexington has been transformed into a blend of funky, hip, and industrial intertwined with lush, upscale design.  A mix of style and comfort that is unique and authentically Asheville.
